Main.cpp
    Edited working frequency (50Hz -> 200Hz), hoping averaging can reduce sensors noise. Also we need to grant greater stability to the board itself.
    Edited correction range, previously was 100 (for yaw, pitch and roll each) thato could lead to a difference in power between two opposing motors of 600, which is way too much.
        Now it is 5 each, that sum up to a difference of 30, that I believe is much more adequate.
    Edited power generator functions as they where compensating in the wrong way any displacement from setpoint 
    Edited the use of cutoff function with sum_e[] as they made no sense.
    Anticipated ESC definition as motors would randomly do extrashort movement if not told otherwise, which caused vibration (bad for sensor calibration)


MPU9150.cpp
    Edited readMagData function, now it returns the magnetometer read only if ready. This should allow higher frequency (at the cost of lower yaw knowledge)
    A possible approach to overcome this issue is to use only gyroscope data to estimate yaw angle.

    Edited readMagData function, I removed the int16_t cachedata array, as it looked redundant, and changed the way destination is generated.

Channel.cpp
    Edited Calibrate and Calibrate read functions (removed the 485-515 if statement as I couldn't see its purpose)
    Added Order 3 Median filter to remove zero drops.
